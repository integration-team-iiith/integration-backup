* Instrumentation and working principles of infra red (IR) spectroscopy using salt plates

** Simulation UI elements

1. Two bottles, half filled with two different colors(each color
   represent different chemical).

2. Two buttons with solution names i.e =Aspirine= and =caffeine=. 

4. Spectrometer image. 

5. Two buttons(start and evaluate) and one blank window to display graph.

Please see simulation's screenshot for more clarifications:
[[./1.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On clicking the button, it should disappear.  

2. On clicking the bottle, a spoon should go inside and pick the
   solution from the bottle and pour it in a vessel.

3. On clicking the vessel, spoon which is inside the vessel should
   move from right to left continuously for 10 secs.

4. On Clicking the bottle a syringe should be shown like extracting
   solution form the bottle(then syringe inside color should be
   changed to some color) and the syringe should move to vessel and
   pour the solution into the vessel(now color inside the syringe
   should be none).

5. On clicking the vessel First :a x element(plate) should appear,
   spoon should take the solution from the bottle and spoon should
   move left to the vessel and pour the solution on to the plate.

6. On clicking the plate, bottles should dissappear and three images
   are placed. on clicking on one image , three images should coincide
   one from top and one from right.

7. On clicking on some element, image should be shown first, then from
   top other element should be inserted into that image.

8. On clicking button, a tab should be opened with graph, calculator
   and quiz questions(basicallly with some content).

* Instrumentation and working principles of solutions infra red (IR) spectroscopy

** Simulation UI elements

1. Three bottles(two half filled with different colors and one empty bottle)

2.  Four buttons(two for solutions and one for start and one for
    evaluate), Desiccator/IR-Cell image, one blank window to display
    graph.

Please see simulation's screenshot for more clarifications:
[[./2.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On clicking the button, two solution buttons should disappear.

2. On clicking the bottle which is half filled with color, in the
   empty bottle same color should be filled.

3. On clicking the other bottle which is half filled with different
   color, then in some x bottle amount of color should increase.

4. On clicking the IRcell image, at some place other image should
   appear.

5. On clicking the x bottle syringe should appear and it should
   extract the solution from the bottle, then the color in the bottle
   should go down slowly and the color in the syringe should go up
   slowly.

6. On clicking the x element color inside element should increase from
   bottom slowly and inside the inserting element color level should
   go down slowly.

7. On clicking x element a image should appear first and then other
   image should be inserted into that image form top slowly.

8. On clicking start button, exp functionality will be shown at some
   place in the UI and a exp related graph is displayed at other place
   in the UI.

9. On clicking evaluate button, a tab should be opened with graph,
   calculator and quiz questions(basicallly with some content).


* Instrumentation and working principles principles of mass spectroscopy

** Simulation UI elements

1. Five buttons

2. Two square boxes and other images related to experiment.

Please see simulation's screenshot for more clarifications:
   [[./3.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On clicking the button the two things should happen firstone :
   sirenge element should move from left to right slowly and stop at
   certain point and then after a sec,bubbles should be shown with
   animation at where the element is stopped. secondone : And when the
   syringe element is moving from left, a square box with arrow on the
   top of the box, should be shown somewhere and the arrow should hit
   the box with animation with non-stop.

2. On clicking the button a image should appear and inside the image
   atoms should move like bubbles and from top of the image atoms
   should fall with nonstop like rain droplets.

3. On clicking the button two things should happen First : a image
   should appear and inside the image, an element should move
   continuously from top to bottom. Second : A square box with arrow
   on the top should be shown somewhere in the UI, and that arrow
   should hit the box continuously.

4. On clicking the button, a image shold appear and inside that image
   from one point, three lines of certain length should be formed
   slowly with an animation.

5. On clicking button, a tab should be opened with graph, calculator
   and quiz questions(basicallly with some content).


* Determination of molar mass of simple compounds using mass spectroscopy

** Simulation UI elements

Please see simulation's screenshot for clarifications:
[[./4.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On clicking the bottle, which is half filled with color, a
   element(syringe) should appear and it should extract the color
   slowly. Next step it should go down slowly and stop near a pipe and
   then color in the pipe should flow like a water and stop at certain
   point.

2. On clickng the bottle a spoon shown should go inside a bottle and
   pick the solution and it should move near a empty bottle and drop
   solution into it.

3.  On Clicking the bottle a syringe should be shown like extracting
    solution form the bottle(then syringe inside color should be
    changed to some color) and the syringe should move to vessel and
    pour the solution into the vessel(now color inside the syringe
    should be none).

4. On clicking the bottle, it should shake and color in the bottle
   should change and same as step1 and same as 1,2,3,4 steps in
   experiment 4.

5. On clicking evaluate button, a tab should be opened with graph,
   calculator and quiz questions(basicallly with some content).

* Nuclear magnetic resosnace spectrocopy and evaulation of simple 1H NMR spectra of select organic compounds


** Simulation UI elements

1. Buttons

2. One blank window to display graph, some images related to
   Experiment.

Please see simulation's screenshot for more clarifications:
[[./5.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On page load, an element should move clockwise and anticlockwise
   continuously.

2. On clicking the button, table should be shown with row and three
   column and each column should be filled with button.

3. On clicking the button, an x element should be filled with color.

4. On clicking the button, waves should move from left to right
   continuously.

5. On clicking evaluate button, a tab should be opened with graph,
   calculator and quiz questions(basicallly with some content).

6. On clicking the plot button a graph should be drawn.

* Identification of unknown components using spectroscopic techniques.

** Simulation UI elements

Please see simulation's screenshot for more clarifications:
[[./6.Screenshot.png][Simulation's Screenshot]]

** Procedure

1. On clicking the button, three rectangular boxes should be displayed
   with some text inside in it and text with instruction outside.

2. On clicking other button also, three rectangular boxes should be
   displayed with some text inside in it and text with instruction
   outside. -> On clicking the first box, a new window with experiment
   will be opened, which is same as experiment

3. ( UI and all the animations are same.) -> On clicking the second
   box, a new window with experiment will be opened, which is same as
   experiment
